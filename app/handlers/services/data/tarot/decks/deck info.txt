DECKS:
ancient-italian:
This Lo Scarabeo's "Ancient Italian" deck. Apparently a bastard deck composited from several 1800's Italian decks. Images unmodified, source unknown: I first downloaded these years ago to make my tarot-of-the-day browser homepage.

rider-waite-smith:
Photoshop-modified (color and imperfections) and batch-cropped (if that wasn't obvious) scan of original 1910 Pamela-A deck, originals available here: http://muzendo.jp/blog/?p=19
Note: I've swapped 9.jpg and 12.jpg to match traditional tarot decks. Number never actually visible through Pojo, but keeps it synchronized with JSON data.

cbd-marseille:
Yaov Ben-Dov's update of the Conver Marseille deck. Images unmodified. Freely distributed by (late...) author: http://www.cbdtarot.com/download/
